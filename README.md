# Bank-Desktop-App
This project is a demonstration and prototype of a simple desktop banking application built with Java and equipped to perform tasks such as making simple transactions, deposits, withdrawals and balance checks. Note that a text file (accounts.txt) was used as the pseudo-database as this is only a demonstration.
Be sure to install the Java JDK to be able to view this project.
